Keep only the highest part of a roll. Notice that for a `DiceRoll`, this means keeping the
largest dice in a roll, but for composite dice, it can mean keeping a whole segment.
See the behaviour of `drop` for more information.

**keyword arguments**

- `kind`: Either `:lowest` or `:highest` to keep either the lowest or highest roll or rolls.
- `n`: The number of dice to be kept.
